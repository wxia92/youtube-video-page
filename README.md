Youtube Video Page Clone by William Xia

Description:
This project is a clone of a youtube video page made with only html and css. 

What I Learned:
The header bar was created by putting three containers of elements into a flexbox display. 

The youtube video was embedded with a iframe tag.

I divided the rest of the page up into two sections; the video info/comments section, and the related videos section. A comment block was created then replicated for each comment. The related video block was done in the same manner.

I learned that it is much easier to use flex to center text/images vertically than it is to manually use padding/margins. However, since flex is not fully supported on browsers such as IE, it may be useful to have a backup css code ready.
